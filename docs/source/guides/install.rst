Installation
============

The project requirements has **5 main pillars**: 

1. Frontend
2. Backend
3. Cloud Infrastructure
4. Database
5. Deployment and Configs

The project was built to include both the basic technologies of each domain,
while utilizing up-to-date technologies such ``golang`` for backend, ``AWS`` for cloud ... etc. 



Frontend Reqs 
-------------

**No modern technologies were used the frontend**, as we didn't feel the need to make the project more complex. 
Hence, no requirements are need to be installed here. You just need a browser and a text editor.


Backend Reqs
